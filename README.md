# PyTorch-Simple-MaskRCNN
A PyTorch implementation of simple Mask R-CNN.

This repository is a toy example Mask R-CNN with two features:
- It is pure python code and can be run immediately using PyTorch 1.4 without build
- Simplified construction and easy to understand how the model works

## Requirements

python 3.7

pytorch 1.4

optional
```
matplotlib
```


## Datasets

Currently only support VOC 2012
```
http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/
```

## Train

- Adjust parameters in ```train.ipynb``` to train the model
